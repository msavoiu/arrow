# Arrow
Social tool created with the aroace (aromantic/asexual) community in mind. Find friends, partners, and aromantic/asexual/LGBTQ+ events near you!

<!-- ## About
As I've gotten older, I've noticed increasing emphasis being placed on romantic and sexual partnerships in a way that kind of relegates friendship to the sidelines.

The aroace community can often feel the impacts of this mindset shift the hardest, as they often don't seek out and enter romantic and sexual relationships with others. Arrow was made for those in the community to meet other aroace individuals in a world where it can be difficult for them to create these connections. -->

With an Arrow account, you can:
- 🫂 Match with other users with similar identities and relationship goals
- 📍 Find other aromantics/asexuals near you with an interactive user map
- 🔔 Stay updated on about in-person aroace/LGBTQ+ meetups in your area
